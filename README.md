A sample project demonstrating the basics of test-driven development in Laravel.

Comment: the code is old, and in some places faulty. Somewhere in the middle of the
tutorial, I found myself more fixing the app so it is working than learning TDD. 

There was a middleware issue, session related issue, missing Request $request in the store method.
So I stopped here, and switched to another tut.
